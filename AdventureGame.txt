Adventure Game in C++

Apartment, gas station, cemetery, liquor store, library, arcade,

Need to implement UI of some kind. An inventory.

Inventory stutter when moving. Solved draw inventory outside of beginMode2d(camera) endMode2d()

NPCs. Edit the man animation to look different. Make a different struct called NPC. The color of the NPC should be blue grey to blend in with the background and make the player character stand out
from the crowd, literally. Maybe we don't need a struct nah we do.

I've decided it's going to be a class saved in a separate file. NPC.h as a header file. and NPC.cpp as the code that runs the animation and updates and renders the NPC.
It will use one big sprite sheet. The sheet will be laid out like a grid. each row of the grid will be a different animation. then we can iterate the grid and grid[0][0] would be idle
then grid[1][0] would be walk and so on.

Laptop computer instead of typewriter. Clicking it brings up an interface. Check your emails.

NPCs Interaction. Standing next to a NPC and clicking on them will make them stop moving and a dialog box appears above their head. Randomized speech will be displayed. Certain NPCs can sell you drugs. 

Police? Police will beat you up if you click on them more than once. First they say "move along". Then they beat you up and you wake up back at the apartment the next day. 

work:
	the car moves forward out of the screen, fade to black. Fade back in car is back at it's spot and you are 100 dollars richer. 

Tavern:
	Take the road to the tavern. Meet story characters of some kind. Buy a drink and we will apply a drunk shader. What's the story? People at the tavern tell rumors of a ghost at the Cemetery. 

Draw a 1980s style phone next to the laptop

Game turns to a zombie apocalypse on the year 2000. Guns are allowed on the street. Zombies chase NPCs and turn them into more zombies.

What is the game about in the mean time. A fetch quest for a special NPC. Hidden drug dealer interaction. The dealer NPC will sell you drugs for 500 dollars. DMT. Apply a water shader to the entire screen. Make it wavy plus a warped CRT effect. 

River City Nights. Rad City Blues. Zombie City Blues. Zed City Blues. Zed City Nights. City Nights 

if player gets more than 1000 pixels away from the apartment in any direction, the player can then sleep again. Or if they travel the road they can sleep. You can't just go sleep to work to sleep to work. You would need to walk around or travel to reset it. This will not be explained to the player. x

interactable NPCs. Just try to make them stop when clicked on. Need a hit box. they already have a hitbox. Make sure you can't click on zombies and talk to them. if interactingtexture(hitbox, mousepos)

test if you can click on zombies

Added shaders. Drunk shader, Glow shader, and glitch shader. Glow shader runs when you take drugs and lasts until you sleep. Glitch shader runs when zombies are spawning for dramatic effect. Drunk shader will run when you drink. Drunk shader overrides glow shader. 

Need to add liquor store. Replace antiques store. You can buy whiskey. Maybe just a buy menu, no interior. 

Police man x

Need something new to work on. Another NPC? Another layer to the parallax?, Liquor store interior. Empty lot. x

another NPC:
	Another female. woman2 
	Homeless man. x

added empty lot. along with hobo NPC. Hobo will have some useful information for the player. Will warn the player of the coming zombie appacolypse. gives the player the shovel? shotgun? 

The Shovel:
	Can be used at certain locations to dig. Will have to telegraph dig spots. Hobo lends you a shovel that you use to dig up the shotgun. Need another item. Health pot. mana? pain killers. 

	were do you get pain killers? dealer?

	make the shotgun an item just like the shovel. it's in the vacant lot. draw it first. 

	The hobo mentions he dropped his shovel in the cemetery. You can access the cemetery without a gun. Should we delay spawning 
	zombies until you have talked to the hobo? and don't draw the shovel until then also. 

telegraph vacant lot location with a street light and a dialog box that pops up when over lot. 
Dialog boxes now pop up when player is over car, apartment, and vacant lot. 

You can now interact with NPCs by pressing up while next to them. Most of the game can be played with just the keyboard. just not the apartment. 

interactive tutorial to start the game. "Arrow keys or A, D to move" "Up or W to enter area"

what do you dig up in the vacant lot? The shotgun? pills? shot gun would make sense. You would need to get the shovel with just the pistol. It's a bit more challenging but very doable. Once you have the shotgun all the zombies are gone. We need another reason to go back to the cemetery. Dig up the key to the cemetery in the vacant lot with the shovel got from the cemetery.

we are running out of space in the inventory all ready. Need to space things out more. Maybe the hobo isn't there at the beginning of the game. Maybe an old lady looking for her lost cat, fluffy. The cat is in the tree. You need to talk to the cat and convince him to come down from the tree. Maybe you need to find some food at the gas station to get him down. Cat nip can be bought at the gas station. which requires you to go to work to get the money. which requires you to sleep to advance the day. Only once the day has been advanced say 2 days then the hobo shows up in his spot.

There is a portal in the graveyard that is summoning zombies. It needs to be closed some how. 

Fortune teller NPC. will give vague phrases about the future, based on a over complicated way of calculating which phrase. 
if the fortune teller says one thing, then the next thing is twice as likely to happen ect ect..get chatGPT to handle the details. 


"A shovel lost is a path revealed; seek it where the forgotten dwell." by ChatGPT

Old lady NPC

inside the cemetery is more graves. We show a layer of graves in front of the player. It slightly obscures the view. 

Dig up the cemetery key and use it on the door. Need dialog box above door in cemetery. "Locked\nNeeds key

use the same background for inner cemetery. Just put another layer in front. like the vacant lot its the cemetery from the opposite direction. So show the inside of the fence looking out. So just trees. what's inside cemetery interior? More zombies. ghosts. Skeletons. animated skele walk

taking drugs reveals secret path to new area. -chatGPT o1 preview

"NecroTech." company name found on id badge on a dead zombie. 

dead zombie body stays and is clickable. click or up key the dead zombie for id badge

Need a reason to back to apartment. Use computer to look up NecroTech? 

Fixed hobo glitch by setting riseTimer to 0 for non zombies. It was playing rise animation for NPCs when there was no such animation.

One you have the ID card, you can search "NecroTech" on the "internet" on your laptop in the apartment. This gives you an address, and adds another destination to the destinations menu on the car. It's NecroTech HQ. There are army guys with guns protecting the place. Break in and kill the CEO to win the game. 

Add a ghost to the cemetery

Add skip dialog 

move background (stars) on cemetery to the left 1024

make limited ammo for shotgun. global shells x

use ambient modular synth from you tube as the soundtrack. Bleak minimal just like the rest of the game. 

Ghost won't attack unless provoked. 

If you don't attack the ghost he gives a mission to find something for him. 

shotgun shells icon. digspot with shotgun shells. 

fortune teller is fucked. remove and start over. 
fixed fortune teller. She just displays a random fortune for 100 dollars. Leave it for now. 

Drugs allow you to see hidden door somewhere outside. Draw this hidden door. 

Hidden door leads to another parallax background image.Use existing art, bus stop drawing. or draw something new. Like what?
Outer space with planets in the background, parallax clouds roll by. What is the point of this new area? Maybe you can help the ghost character by visiting the astral plane and recovering a lost relic of some kind. What relic? A pocket watch, ring, amulet, 
Pocket watch seems like it fits. He lost his watch and is doomed to haunt the graveyard until it is returned. Maybe he comes back to life if you return the watch. 

What enemies could be in the astral plane. Maybe you will be running on top of clouds with a space scene in the background with ghosts attacking you. Maybe a skeleton NPC just because of Halloween. Animate a skeleton walking then. 

Implemented the astral plane. You access it by taking drugs and opening the magic door. I just drew parallax layers of clouds in the same color pallet. Consider a more technicolor palette. Drug shader effect stays on when in the astral realm. Consider a different shader, maybe the same glow shader with different parameters. 

The plan was, the ghost asks you to find his lost relic. He speaks in riddles and rhymes. Something about a door and an altered mind. Giving the hint that you need to take drug to find his lost relic. It's a bit obtuse. His lost relic is an old pocket watch. Why would you find a pocket watch in the astral realm. You need to fight a boss? A witch. A giant steam punk clockwork automaton. A giant spider. A disembodied head. A scare crow. 

Guns work on the astral plane. Need mini ghosts or spirits of some kind. Flying enemies. Diver bomb the player and are only able to be hit when diving down to player level. Crows? that circle. Just like rad city crows. Needs to be evil spirits or something that fits with the astral realm. 

what else. Implemented reverse road car headlights/break lights. light_scale = -1.0 // Negative scale to flip horizontally 

Had chatGPT come up with rhymes that the ghost says. I got a list of a million of them. Need to turn off ghost agro when leaving the area. Moved ghost to graveyard instead of cemetery. To spread things out more. 

Added notes to github, so there is a record of this madness. 

Added my own original background track. It's only 3:30 minutes long. Not long enough. gets repetative. Need another music track for when zombies are spawning, new song while in astral realm. Slow down play back when on drugs? Maybe add echo effect. Just have 2 different tracks. One for sober, one for drugged. Play the song in reverse and see how it sounds. 

Make your own mixer. Tracks can be playing without being heard? So we can fade from one to another and have it be lined up. 
Add seek function to sound manager.

added shovel pickup sound effect. 

bug on cemetery near shovel pickup. bullets get stopped by an invisible barrier some how. ** ghost is blocking bullets from beyond the grave.Ghost was set to active while outside of graveyard. **set ghost.isactive to false before setting it true when rendering graveyard. I think NPCs outside are set to active outside of outside? Doesn't seem to effect things. They don't stop bullets because they are not zombies or ghosts. What happens if you want pedestrian NPCs to get hit by bullets. I don't want that.  
 
leaving outside by car, car speed is still set to fast after return from cemetery

Gotta try a new song. current one is too...I don't know what. The beat gets in the way lets say. 

Needs to be like a ambient synth wave. Or like a solo acoustic guitar. and it plays a little riff every time you interact. Since we are also playing street noise it has to be minimal I think. take another stab at a super ambient no melody background swells. 

it takes all day to write a song. 

Astral Traders: Merchants who sell unique items or artifacts not available elsewhere.

Verticality. The player can some how move to higher platforms. floating platforms on the astral plane. Player takes doors that teleport the player to a higher platform. jump pads. jetpack. ability to fly. Maybe flight with very low gravity. 
"Press space bar to fly". flying animation. 

added another cloud layer. 

Added physics to player. Velocity, acceleration/deceleration, jump, gravity, isOnFloor ect. 

Do we just not allow jumping unless it's the astral plane? Or do we leave a weak jump and then a strong jump when in astral. 
I think weak jump, more player input is better even if it doesn't do anything. 

If the player jumps and shoots at the same time he dives like the matrix. Dodge roll? invincibility frames as a way to slide by zombies without being hit. There is not enough combat to justify a mechanic like this. Are we making a platformer or an adventure game? Leave the jump for now and see what happens.

need sound when taking pills x

when you receive the cemetery key, raiseZombies = true x

Need another enemy. Flying enemy? crows wont work. They are too dark. outline them. red eyes. act like swarm

make the health bar green. Health bar looks too much like a platform. give it a texture? like a thermometer semi transparent

ghost in graveyard needs to stay on the left side. narrow it's destination range. 

Enemies on platforms. ghosts can fly? ghost should be able to track the player on the y axis as well. astral ghost start agro?

Added enemy bats. seems lame. Redo sprite. Needs better behavior. whats the point of bats if they only move left and right.  

wait...\n\n your not like the others

Need ranged enemy. slow projectile, enemy people. cultists, private contractors. Men in black. 

added MiB. They show up after you get the cemetery key. What could they do? if you click on them you die and wake up back at the apartment. Maybe they follow you up to say 150 pixels then stop. if closer they stay stopped. otherwise follow

Maybe the mib will show up on the astral plane, they will carry guns as well.

need a check so that fortune tellers dialog is prioritized. Teller var. if !teller

Solved long standing bug with NPC speech. You can now skip dialog by clicking or pressing up. solves a host of other issues. If you click the npc a second time it stops the talk timer. It was that easy, just needed to not look at it for a while to see. 

revisit platforming later maybe you will find fixes for some of those bugs. 

I wonder if I could take my bat sprite and add a shader to just that draw call, then do some funky shader stuff to turn the bat into an astral bat. Shimmering semi transparent wraith like apparition.  

added outline shader to player. Maybe it's better this way all the time? 

continue with shaders on other sprites. ghost could glow, bats could be astral bats, could we do blood with shaders?

we could active outline shader when on drugs. or a glitch shader on the player or something else. 

bullets could glow. add shader to street lights?

After dying, going to the cemetery doesn't work on the first try. It fades out then fades back to street. 

Policeman is broken. fixed by setting destination to position when attacking. Needed same fix for zombie. how was it working before? we will never know. If you just walk away from police, they get stuck mid animation and don't attack. How to solve this. The player is stopped by the police if they touch them. This gives time for the attack to happen. Like a stun lock, but you should be able to run out of it. How can we call player from npc. in main track player and police NPC positions. if they intersect stop the player for 1 second. 

Try more shaders. outline shader on bats. 

experiment with gravity on the astral plane. slightly less. 

Added rainbow outline shader. We draw an outline around the sprite and replace the inner pixels with a rainbow color. Try a black outline. Looks ok. A larger bat could be cool. Need a plan for the astral plane. You can visit it any time unless we don't draw the dealer until later in the game. Maybe you need to have the revolver first before we show the dealer. Need a boss of the astral plane. It should be an archetype. Death, a grim reaper. an evil wizard, a witch. an Angel of death. The astral plane should be it's own game. There should be a reason to leave and come back. Ghost is asking to find his lost relic. a pocket watch doesn't make sense being in the astral plane. 

Maybe the player needs to take drugs while standing next to the ghost in the cemetery to make a magic door appear. Freeing the ghost. 

There is a friendly NPC in the astral realm. He sells astral wares, He also sells a potion. which is another drug you can take.
He also sells an old pocket watch, that belongs to the ghost in the graveyard. He sits on top of a platforming puzzle, half way up. Maybe he sells an item needed to fight what ever the boss would be at the very top of the platforms. 

While climbing the platforms we show different planets as the player gets higher. 

Cemetery gate needs dialog box saying "Locked"

Revisit foreground. Made the foreground even wider 1600 * 4. 6400 x 1024. Now I just need to draw in a bunch of new buildings and move the left and right barrier. could make the cemetery or graveyard wider. maybe there is an old haunted house next to the cemetery further to the right. or some old insane lady lives there and gives you an item or something. She's secretly a witch and spawns a bunch of skeletons to attack you. She temporarily turns you into a frog. The camera zooms way in on a frog sprite with jump animation and everything. A big mansion house could look cool in these colors. 

There is a dig spot on the far left of the street. 

Added an animated UFO that floats above the cemetery after you have the badge. Reused old picture of UFO that seems to fit the style and colors. Need to add light cone beneath the UFO that turns on when your underneath it. Go from there. use draw texture pro to stretch the light cone to fit say 64x256. Made light bar. A bar of light 32 by 256. 

UFOs to controversial? Fuck em, it's a piece of art. I'll make what I want. 

When and where to UFOs show up? Need another location that isn't the cemetery. Library? police station, tavern, park?

a park would make sense. An NPC asks you to meet them in the park. they have some information on the zombies. 

You can enter an apartment in the building down the street. Draw building lobby? press a buzzer for the apartment. Elevator. I wish some one else could write the story.

If you walked all the way to the left when outside. A UFO drops down from the sky, then shoots off at incredible speed.

UFO needs a sound effect.

Added a low hum with positional audio. Consider positional audio for player_car. When car drives away it's sound could fade out.

apply drunk shader to ufo. Too subtle. rainbow outline shader looks cool, could transition from shader to shader. 

You meet the boss NPC in the park. He warns you to stay out of it. He then disappears and zombies spawn. He's a necromancer CEO of NecroTech. Maybe there are pedestrians in the park who can get attacked by zombies. Start by putting NPCs in park. 

MiB talk to you at park if you have the cemetery key. 

Tried using vignette shader colored red to indicate taking damage. I could not pass player to shadercontrol.h it would break everything for some reason. but I can update the shader from main anyway. SetShaderValue(shaders.vignetteShader, ect) Since we store shaders in a struct that is shared with main. Still won't work. Just use a texture. Draw a semi transparent Red vignette the size of the screen 1024x1024. show it when hitTimer > 0;

if within 15 attack, if within 10 stop. 


for each zombie, iterate NPCs in park, return the closest NPC, hasTarget = true, destination = NPC.position

Don't spawn zombies if you don't have the revolver. It could be pretty tragic if someone missed the gun and got killed by zombies. 

Draw trees in the park foreground, possibly mid ground trees?

If you talk to the MiB in the park, he say's "we are watching you", then vanishes, then zombies raise from the ground and start attacking the pedestrians. He only shows up if you have the cemetery key. Zombie/pedestrian behavior is till a little buggy. NPCs now seem to set a new destination when they are hit, so it looks like they try to run away. I think I'll keep it like that for now but it might look better if they just stand there and take it. 

Zombie/pedestrian interaction uses pointers. We iterate 2 vectors and set a pointer from zombie in one vector to NPC in another. So zombie can call take damage on NPC. First time I've needed pointers so far. 

Need dramatic version of the music for zombie attacks. 

Game is getting too big to keep in my head. What happens in the game so far. You start under the street light outside your apartment. You can either go to the apartment and get your keys and the gun, or you can talk to the homeless guy, but you need to do both for zombies to spawn in the cemetery. If you visit the cemetery before this, it is empty. Once getting to the cemetery, zombies ambush you once you get out of your car. You can then walk left to find the shovel where zombies again attack. You can go right and find nothing but another zombie attack. the gate says locked. So you go back to main street. There are NPCs to interact with on main street like the dealer, the fortune teller, the liquor store also. At some point you need to go back to the hobo and talk to him again. He says zombies are gathering in the cemetery before invading the city and you need to stop them. He gives you the key to the cemetery gate, and tells you where to dig up the shotgun. You then return to the cemetery where you are ambushed again. You then can enter the graveyard. You can go left and talk to the ghost who says a cryptic rhyme about setting him free. You can go right and get ambushed by zombies. The first zombie you kill drops a dead body with a ID card. You can pick up the ID card and it says it belongs to some one who works for a company named necrotech. You again return to the hobo who says necrotech was his old employer and you should use your computer to look up necrotech, once you do a new destination is on the car menu. That is how far that story ark goes. The ghost story arc is you talk to the ghost you says you need an altered mind. You talk to the dealer and buy drugs. You take the drugs on main street and find a magic door. This leads to the astral realm. There are platforms and astral bats to fight on the astral plane. Platforms lead up to a really high big platform where a boss fight will take place. I forgot to mention if you walk to the far left when on main street a UFO drops down out of the sky, and shines a beam of light onto the player. Once you have the cemetery key the UFO appears in the cemetery for no reason right now. And that is about it. 

So you could continue the Necrotech ark, or make a boss for the astral plane, or remove the UFO from the cemetery. 

Not sure I like the necrotech idea, but you can always change it. 

fixed hobo moving while trying to talk. refactored some code and it seemed to fix it, also fixed zombies bugging out when out of range of player. 

Implement full screen feature. Involves drawing everything to a separate texture then resizing said texture. We could use this for shaders as well I think. If we are drawing to a separate texture anyway, why not apply shaders to it. 

implemented multi pass rendering. BeginTextureMode(targetTexture) saves whatever is drawn under it to a target texture2D. We can then add shaders to the whole scene and save it to yet another texture before we draw that texture to the screen while applying more shaders. There are 4 passes. targetTexture, vignetteTexture, finalTexture, then draw to screen where more individual shaders are applied. Looking at it now, I see I can add vignette texture to the starting targetTexture to save a step. But I might need another pass in the future so I can just replace vignette with whatever that is. 

Added old film shader. Could be used for a cut scene. Adds film grain, horizontal line glitches, sepia tone, and something else. It's added to the finalTexture pass, and only runs if film is true. film grain is cool looking. Maybe an underground area we could apply film grain because it looks good on black. implies darkness. Subway station? 

Ghost is broken. Does not follow player once attacked. in graveyard. x

zombie npc attack still buggy. x

put rainbow outline shader on magic door. x

if you die in astral gravity is not set back to normal on respawn. x

background street light look muddied. from copying the image so may times? Just remove for now. x

fixed full screen, add UI to renderTexture before drawing to screen that way their positions are baked into the image. x

Add trees to the park. x

Astral boss. x 2 ghosts are the boss of astral until I can think of something. 

fix zombies, zombies occasionally flip left and right really fast for some reason. 

if a NPC is killed by a zombie. Spawn a zombie at that position. Needed to wait for death animation before raising zombie. 

NPCs should interact with each other some how. We would need more than one Dbox. We could make a dialog box class. It has a position, a std::string of what it says, font size, timer? This would be very complicated to deconstruct what I have now for something new. 

multiple calls to draw dialog box would do what. make it jump between 2 positions each frame? show_dbox is global. test calling it twice. it would just draw it at the last position you call. 

click on inventory to switch weapons? x inventory item select code is getting out of hand. 

Added mac10 to the top of the astral plane. You needed a reward for getting to the top of the platforms, so this will do for now.
Doesn't make much sense to find a gun on the astral plane. You can get the mac10 at the very beginning of the game. good.

zombie spawn delay is too short. x

drugs ware off when exiting astral. x

fix car tires. 

fix midground buildings x

upkey on mac10 in astral not working. x 

fall through platform gravity is borked. x Just had to apply gravity last. And flush excess velocity when landing on a platform, it kept it's downward velocity from falling, needed to reset to 0 when jumping and landing on platform. needs to only run once to prevent jumps being inconsistent. Platforming is very simple but more or less working. 

if health < 100 show health bar else show_healthbar = false x

flying saucer didn't show. if (position.x < 64 && gameState == OUTSIDE) x

if you were to make a save feature, what would you need to save? player.position, hasGun, hasShotgun, hasMac10, hasCemeteryKey, hasPills, hasWhiskey, basically save the state of the player class, gameState, money, date, it would be a nightmare basically.

tried to refactor dialogBox. Reverted back to what I had. I tried making a dialog box class, got it all working and realized it was 10 times more complicated than doing it all in one function like I had been. Just clean up the offsets. 

Need another NPC. dude with a gun. special forces, mercenaries, private contractors, pirates, 

added highlight shader to NPCs. Draw a white outline around the NPCs if they are interacting. Looks a bit odd, because "interacting" is on a 5 second timer. So the highlight turns on and off while talking to the hobo for example. A solution may be to just draw the highlight when the players position is closer than 20 pixels or something. That would mean NPC would become highlighted while walking past. Maybe if interacting, turn on highlight, but don't turn it off until the player is a certain distance away? Clicking on the NPC would initiate highlight, can't think of a better way than distance to player to turn it off. Do it then. Need another boolean. highLight turns on when interacting and turns off when 30 pixels away. x

Implemented. Works way better this way. Possibly don't need interacting timer. Maybe player could have a member variable interacting as well. To prevent interacting with multiple NPCs at once. 

abandoned underground subway station. Filled with mutated rat people with guns. murder your way through tunnels until you find the king of the rats. He's an NPC that you talk to about something or other. There are rats with dynamite that blow themselves up. 

Added subway level. How to incorporate it into the game? Maybe once you trigger zombies in the park, they are triggered everywhere. the subway then becomes another place to fight enemies. Still needs a reason for the first half of the game. You can take the subway to yet another area. or to the park. ditch the car? subway costs money? Just hook it up to the park for now. Need a subway station in the park. 

We have one subway station that you can exit into different areas. enter subway, pick destination, animate train with player on it, camera follows train. fadeout. fade back in to the same subway with character outside of train. train menu displays different destinations, exiting station takes you to park or whatever the destination was.

Need boolean again. exitToPark, exitToOutside, 

You have a limited time to catch the train. If you miss it you have to wait for another one. The menu pops up automatically when you stand near the door of the train car.

some how make the player board the train. stand by train door. UI comes up. Hit park, player.position = train.position, trainTimer = maxtime so train leaves immediatly FADEOUT as the train is moving. 

ghost is too transparent. x

change Car UI to look like the rest of the UI x

change train timing, it's too long of a wait. 17 seconds. 7500 start change to 5500

you can drive to the park, then take the subway, and it will bring you to the park and the car will be gone. Need to resolve this somehow. If you take the car to the park, exitToSubay or whatever = true, but then we don't draw the car, we would need yet another boolean. carToPark

The car magically teleports home if you take the car to the park and the subway back. 

Need something new to work on. Boss fight in astral. Just put a ghost there for now and have it agro some how when play gets close. 

it should say up to exit above exit in the lot. 

bat are bugging out. flying erratically. Are they comparing against themselves?

Make a Main Menu. raygui? or text that highlights when hovered. or both. rayGUI can probably do that, color text. 

				PLAY - exits menu
				FULLSCREEN
				QUIT 

implement pause using enum state

move up to exit position to center in Lot

fix car wheels

UFO in cemetery makes sounds on main street. 


in lot, up to exit position needs to be set when player is over exit. 



New plan:

	Test the game. x
	Fix the bugs. x
	Make a release. x
	Post about it.  x

1/10/2025
New new plan. Where was I. Pick up where you last left off. Necro Tech. Finish drawing NT headquarters. Take the road to hq?
It supposed to be an office building in the city. Maybe you need to take the subway there, but that makes no sense. It's already set up to take the car to nt hq so go with that for now. Draw a barbed wire fence that blocks off the rest of the area except for the entrance to the building. Once in the building then what? 

Entering Necro Tech HQ, you are met by security guards. It then turns into the lobby scene from the Matrix. Maybe You are just met by zombies. The zombies have already taken over the lower levels of the building. Once you visit Necro Tech is when zombies start invading other areas of the game. like outside and the subway.

The interior of the building is a bunch of platforms and elevators. There are scientists being chased around by zombies, and security guards with guns. Security is hostile towards everyone, like half-life. 

Platforms and elevators would be a pretty big job. Maybe just corridors and elevators. Would we render each corridor with an elevator at the end that transitions to the next. Lobby, Level 1, level 2, penthouse. Cause if we do platforms we would need to deal with zombies on platforms and gravity. Elevator scene between each level. 

Maybe just outside, lobby, elevator, penthouse boss battle. 

Necro tech hq oustide, the camera is locked zoomed way out. To give you a sense of scale for how big the building is. That means the image needs to be wide enough for the camera. Will need to start with just a 1024 square image then adjust once it's halfway implemented. 1024 x 4. 4096

Is there a secret third option? 

renderHeadquarters(GameResources& resources, player, player_car, shaders){
	drawBackground
	outside security? 
}

new new new plan:
	Make astral plane better, boss or another enemy, turrets? slow moving projectiles. 


changing player_car texture doesn't change it in game. Maybe because we are rendering it at a lower resolution. The up res doesn't work. it can't be this because we changed the color and it didn't change in game. Do I need to push to github or something for changes to stick. 


Puzzles:

	moveable boxes. pressure pads. shootable switches. lasers. timing puzzle with moving lasers.

necrotech lobby is guarded by a laser grid. The lasers blink on and off in a pattern and possibly move. The player must navigate the lasers to enter the building. 

enemy robots, AI controls necrotech. 

The necrotech building goes off screen it's so tall. we don't need to zoom out. Just get it in game, fuck the resolution.

render the same background as street just change the foreground. 

ok, necro tech hq is implemented. Now what. There needs to be something that happens to justify this screen's existence. 

You are met by 2 robots. They banter back and forth with each other on whether to let you inside. They decide they will kill you instead and shoot you with lasers. What do the robots look like? Humanoid? tank tracks, floating, a floating eyeball drone. We could use ufo code to make it wobble. draw it then. 

forgot to get NPC by reference, was stuck for like 2 hours. for (NPC& robot : robots) forgot the &.

robot can patrol around what next. if agro he chases player up to a point then shoots. add bob to robots

if you interact with the door to the building robots get agro. 

worldToScreen(mousePosition) needed to be calculated inside beginMode2d() to get the proper coordinates based on the camera.
I was getting the worldMousePosition before setting up the camera, but it just happens to work for the first 9 scenes, but not the new one. Strange but we caught a bug that could have caused future issues. 

in handleRobot make robot stop 100 pixels away from player when chasing. Then draw shoot animation/bullet? bullets can look different? We should use existing bullet code just add a way to change the appearance. x

robots shoot lasers, only lasers hurt player, laser is a member var of bullet class. eventually we may need to have bullets hit player as well as lasers. just make another member variable enemy_bullet. then check if laser || enemy_bullet. 

Next make the robot able to talk. HandleNPCInteraction -> if robot: talk timer = ...ect...
